# 1. Overview   
The aim of this application is to offer parents a source of inspiration and help them choose an appropriate walk for the whole family, considering the little feet especially. Furthermore, the app is encouraging parents to share their own favourite walks so that others could enjoy them too.
# 2. UX  
From a user's point of view the application should be intuitive and easy to use whilst presenting the information in a manner that would make the visitor come back in the future.

## 2.3 Design
The project uses Materialize framework and it's grid system that allows the project to be responsive across different devices.  
### Colour scheme
For simplicity the project uses Materialize's colour scheme, the following being chosen:
- ![#388e3c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/388e3c/000000?text=+) #388e3c (green darken-2)
- ![#e8f5e9](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e8f5e9/000000?text=+) #e8f5e9 (green lighten-5)
- ![#ff8f00](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff8f00/000000?text=+) #ff8f00 (amber darken-3)  


 For Header, Footer and call to action buttons the colour being used is green darken-2, to represent the green found on walks most of the year. Also green lighten-5, a pale shade of green, is used as background for flashed messages and cards.   
For Cancel/Delete buttons the colour chosen was amber darken-3, the colour of leaves in autumn, to represent a warning about the action to be made.

### Font
The font used is trying to suggest that the walks have a personal touch, being hand-written by the user, hence the cursive Google font *Architects Daughter* was chosen.
